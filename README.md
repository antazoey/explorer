[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4fff1f7f-315e-46dd-b821-2ddae569ebbc/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/vega-testnet-explorer/deploys)

This repo contains two things:
- A Go service that unpacks Vega transactions from Tendermint
- A client-side block explorer

## API
The [API](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/explorer/tree/master/api) is a handy tool for decoding Vega transactions. By posting a block height and node to it, you will get back the decoded transactions:

| Property  | Value | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `block_height`  | integer  | The block you are interested in |
| `node_url`  | string  | The URL to a node serving a [Tendermint RPC interface](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/rpc/) |

### Example request
```bash
curl 'https://explorer.vega.trading/.netlify/functions/chain-explorer-api' \
      --data-raw '{"block_height":3,"node_url":"https://n01.d.vega.xyz/tm/"}'
```

    "Nonce": 15906718751856568000
  }
]
```

## Deployment
Both the Go service & site are deployed to Netlify on build. Check out the Makefile to see what is involved there.

## Dependencies
The resulting site is *fragile* as it depends on:
- The Go service correctly decoding transactions;
- [Vega](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega)'s GraphQL API
- [Vega](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega)'s REST API
- [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint)'s RPC

So the chances of updates somewhere along the line breaking this are... pretty high!
